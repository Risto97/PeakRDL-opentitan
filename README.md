#### SystemRDL <-> Opentitan regblock HWjson description importer exporter

These 2 formats solve a similar problem, aim of the tool is to provide a tool to easily migrate from one format to another and hopefully reuse PeakRDL toolchain for opentitan peripherals, also use SystemRDL IP blocks with opentitan tools.

This is just a proof of concept repository at the moment and provides very basic SystemRDL to OpenTitan format conversion
